    <!-- ABOUT ME STORY -->

    <article id="story" class="container">
      <h2 class="center-align blue-grey-text text-lighten-3">My Story</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">
      I am a full stack developer, passionate about back end development. My
      development history began as a curiosity, in community college. At that
      time, I decided to find out if my ideas about coding were more than just
      fantasies. They were. I took two introductory courses to learn, Java and
      object oriented programming, and instantly fell in love with software
      creation.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
      Fast forward graduating from community college and entering the
      University of Washington, I wanted to continue my pursuit of computer
      science.  However, I incorrectly felt that I was penned into doing
      a major in applied mathematics. Despite finishing my general education
      credits, and taking advantage of the opportunity to complete some CS
      classes (including data structures, algorithms, and databases), I did not
      complete my math degree. For me, Mathematics did not appear to be
      a lifelong pursuit.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
      Luckily, as an aspiring web developer, I found a project to sink my teeth
      into. I worked on a project called Math Affirm, for 2 months. The site
      was built using Ruby on Rails and, as the sole developer, I was able to
      gain first hand experience in creating a full stack app.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
      Following such a positive expereince, I immediately set out to begin
      a career as a web developer. I was not prepared. A few frustrating
      months later, I recieved life changing advice from a friend, whose husband
      had recently made a career shift into web development.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
      In Seattle, I underwent a boot camp called Web Development Immersive,
      offered by General Assembly. GA was an overwhelmingly awesome experience.
      For the first time in my life, I was surrounded by people interested in
      the same thing as me. I became proficient in JavaScript and learned to
      use both JavaScript and Python as back end development languages.
      Suprisingly for me, I also found joy in front end development (when aided
      by clever and powerful libraries, such as React).
      </p>

          Most importantly, that good work and good people can make all the
          difference in the world. Good work gives you the ability to work
          harder and longer, without burnout. Having good people around you
          keeps you motivated, where otherwise you would falter.

          The struggle of dedicating myself to hard work, that I was not

          application showed me how easy it was to get immersed in good work.

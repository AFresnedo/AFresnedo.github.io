<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>As a developer...</h3>
<!-- passions -->
<p class="flow-text">
I am a full stack web developer whose passion lies in designing and
implementing back end solutions. I understand the value of appropriate
model complexity, coupled with effecient databases, in creating robust
and powerful applications.
</p>
<!-- fundementals and awareness -->
<p class="flow-text">
However, none of that is accessible without
capable front end interfaces wired with secure, and maintainble,
routing. I appreciate that front-end frameworks, such as React, are
powerful libraries that leverage the benefits of composite design and
the modularity it enables. Coding controllers to ensure security,
through authentication, authorization, and best practices (while keeping
them thin and maintainable) is always satisfying.

<h3>As a person...</h3>

<!-- VERSION TWO -->

<!-- basic story -->
-grew up loving computers
-programming java in cc was confirmation of fantasies
-went to UW struggled with math but did well in data struc, alg, dbs, gen ed
-lost in life around 20s
-GA was life changing
  -reaffirmed passions
  -worked on projects

<!-- insights/retrospective of story -->
-programming java in cc was confirmation of fantasies
-applied math topics were not engaging
  -solving puzzles/questions versus building solutions
-strong opinions of what is fun and what is important...so trying to be careful
-GA demonstrated immense value of good work and good people
  -10 min walk versus 4 hour commute every day
  -good work, good people lets you overcome obstacles and burnout
-GA demonstrated the value of having projects to get immersed in
  -easiest way to work is to be involved in it

<!-- math affirm -->
-offline input
-user friendly routing
-security
-data driven, data being the teacher problems/answer interfaces/solutions/hints
-tons of database (CRUD) functionality for over 15 tables
-how many models? 12ish?
-agile methodologies

<!-- insights/retrospective on math affirm -->
-do not start from data and build from there, even though it is data driven
-working alone can blind you to your work
-back end solutions are more satisfying than front end solutions
  -even though client appreciated the front end solutions a lot more
-agile: what worked and what didn't work with agile and why
  -client updating designs worked
  -1 man dev team didn't work, no scrum master or anything...too many promises
  -less startup time (previous dev got stuck very early in dev because client
  unable to set mvp)
    -but, i got stuck late in dev near prototype because mvp too big

<!-- man-vs-earth-vs-man -->
-object oriented design
-terrain destruction
-dynamic player count
-easy map imports

<!-- insights/retrospective on mvevm -->
-oop let me user phaser to fast track a lot of features
  -bullets, aiming
-projects can seem intimidating/mere dreams at first but there are moments
where you get rolling and just spit out features/improvements like a fire hose
  -stay optimisitc, stay true to your strategy and design, it'll pay off

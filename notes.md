# two writing perspectives

* difference between content/information and my voice/personality/thoughts

## story/reality/what happened/what it is/content
* technical writing for projects, dry but informative story in about

## opions/insight/reflection/analysis/whats in my head about reality
* accessed through materialize feature discovery

# colors
* white/beige
    * professional/simple backdrop
* green
    * just a color to use....
* blue
    * another color to use that I like
* grey
    * if i need another color for something
* color palette???
    * not sure, but i assume materialize can grab a palette and recolor all
    * to do: using above colors as a starting point, pick a palette

# mobile
* shrinking/rotating structure based on user scroll/link position
    * flexbox implementation

# navigation
* materialize

## navbar
* materialize
    * active link display
    * hamburger icon for mobile
    * logo/full-page link upperleft
    * rest of links upperright
## footer
* social media links
* what else??? recommended pages? no....

# dynamic layout
* react
    * page changes structure based on viewport and page scrolling
* if you click on a section in "full page" mode, it'll rotate/shrink
    * readability
    * show off functionality
* flexbox (any problems with react?)
    * how do i set it up so transitions are not instantaneous?
        * transitions being the rotating section pieces on resize

# hand-written notes
* see binder
    * wireframe
